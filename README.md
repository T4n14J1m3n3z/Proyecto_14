## Building a Model for Automatic Detection of Negative Movie Reviews

Description:
Film Junky Union, an innovative community for classic film enthusiasts, is developing a system to filter and categorize movie reviews. Your goal is to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. Using a labeled dataset of IMDB movie reviews, you'll build a model to classify reviews as positive or negative, aiming to achieve an F1 score of at least 0.85.
